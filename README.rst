|pybio| is a toolkit for biology related computations.

.. warning::
    |pybio| is in a pre-development phase.

    We are designing and prototyping API. Any interface should be considered
    unstable, any implementation is here just for show case.  

|pybio| will try to provide common infrastructure useful for any computation
related to biology.

..
    FIXME: place for small demostration
    Look how easy it is to use::

        import pybio
        # Get your stuff done
        #pybio.do_stuff()

Features
--------

- Documented
- Tested
- Reproducible computations
- Biology & chemistry basic computational infrastructure
- Expandable to any biology related application
- Integrated with major biological databases

.. note::
    *Glycobiology based on mass spectrometry* is first application due to
    authors current field of work
