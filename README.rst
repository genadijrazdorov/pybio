|project|
=========

|project| is a toolkit for biology related computations.

.. warning::
    |project| is in a pre-development phase.

    We are designing and prototyping API. Any interface should be considered
    unstable, any implementation is here just for show case.  

|project| will try to provide common base for any computation related to
biology.

Look how easy it is to use::

    import pybio
    # Get your stuff done
    #pybio.do_stuff()

Features
--------

- tested
- reproducible computations
- biology & chemistry basic computational infrastructure
- expandable to any biology related application
- integrated with major biological databases

.. note::
    *glycobiology based on mass spectrometry* is first application due to
    authors current field of work 

Installation
------------

Install pyBio by running:

    pip install project
